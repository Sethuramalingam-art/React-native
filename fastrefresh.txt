Fast Refresh is a React Native feature that allows you to get near-instant feedback for changes in your React components. Fast Refresh is enabled by default, and you can toggle "Enable Fast Refresh" in the React Native Dev Menu. With Fast Refresh enabled, most edits should be visible within a second or two.

How It Works
If you edit a module that only exports React component(s), Fast Refresh will update the code only for that module, and re-render your component. You can edit anything in that file, including styles, rendering logic, event handlers, or effects.
If you edit a module with exports that aren't React components, Fast Refresh will re-run both that module, and the other modules importing it. So if both Button.js and Modal.js import Theme.js, editing Theme.js will update both components.
Finally, if you edit a file that's imported by modules outside of the React tree, Fast Refresh will fall back to doing a full reload. You might have a file which renders a React component but also exports a value that is imported by a non-React component. 
For example, maybe your component also exports a constant, and a non-React utility module imports it. In that case, consider migrating the constant to a separate file and importing it into both files. This will re-enable Fast Refresh to work. Other cases can usually be solved in a similar way.
